# RetroForge Engine - Project Constitution

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Project:** RetroForge Engine (Go Runtime)

---

## 🎯 Project Mission

**"Create the most accessible and powerful fantasy console for retro game development"**

RetroForge Engine provides a modern, cross-platform runtime for creating retro-style games with the creative constraints that encourage finished projects while offering more capability than traditional 8-bit consoles.

---

## 🏗️ Core Principles

### 1. **Creative Constraints Drive Innovation**
- **Limited resources** (16,384 tokens, 256 sprites, 50 colors) spark creativity
- **Fixed resolution** (480×270) ensures consistent experience
- **Simple APIs** reduce complexity and encourage experimentation
- **Performance limits** (60 FPS, 64MB WASM) force optimization

### 2. **Modern Tools, Retro Soul**
- **Go runtime** for cross-platform compatibility
- **Node system** for modern game architecture
- **Box2D physics** for realistic interactions
- **Lua scripting** for accessible programming
- **Retro aesthetic** with pixel-perfect rendering

### 3. **Developer Experience First**
- **Dual API** (high-level nodes + low-level direct)
- **Comprehensive documentation** with examples
- **Clear error messages** and debugging tools
- **Fast iteration** with hot reloading
- **Cross-platform** development and deployment

### 4. **Community and Learning**
- **Open source** by default
- **Learn by example** through readable cart code
- **Educational focus** for teaching programming
- **Community sharing** of carts and knowledge
- **No barriers** to entry or participation

## 🚫 What We Don't Do

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **Over-engineering** simple features
- **Breaking changes** without migration path
- **Platform lock-in** or vendor dependencies
- **Complex configuration** or setup
- **Performance regressions** in stable releases

### Features We Won't Add
- **True 3D rendering** (2.5D raytracing only)
- **Complex shader systems** (simple materials only)
- **Real-time networking** (local multiplayer only)
- **Cloud storage** (local-first approach)
- **Proprietary formats** (open standards only)

## 🔄 Decision Making Process

### Major Decisions
1. **Constitution alignment** - Does this fit our principles?
2. **Community input** - What do users think?
3. **Technical feasibility** - Can we implement it well?
4. **Performance impact** - Does it meet our standards?
5. **Documentation** - Can we explain it clearly?

### Implementation Process
1. **Specification** - Detailed technical spec
2. **Prototype** - Proof of concept
3. **Testing** - Comprehensive test suite
4. **Documentation** - Complete API docs
5. **Release** - Stable, well-tested feature
